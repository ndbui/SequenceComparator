SequenceComparator
================
[![Build Status](https://github.com/ndbui/SequenceComparator.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/ndbui/SequenceComparator.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)


This project will primarily be used in the aid of studying how certain genetic elements inhibit growth in strains of bacteria (Streptococci in this instance) by comparing two groups of genomes, where one group is known to inhibit growth, and identifying genetic elements that are shared/distinct between them.



## Using this project

The input of this project are NCBI annotated genomes exported in .txt format. Place each exported annotated genome in the `src/input/` directory of this project where each genome is in its own .txt file
